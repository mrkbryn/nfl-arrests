# NFL Arrests
## Made by Mark Bryan with data from NFLArrest.com
_A simple example of API access and master-detail organization of information._

This project is based on the data from [NFLArrest.com](http://nflarrest.com/), which is accessed through the NFL Arrest API. Made as an illustration of the master-detail layout of an app and API access in Objective-C, the app brings in data on the top crime-committing NFL players (from Jan. 1, 2000-present) and displays it in a simple way.

### App Organization
Currently, the list is ordered in descending order by number of arrests committed for each player. Tapping a player's cell (no pun intented) brings up a detail view of the player, including a list of each arrest, its date, the team of the player when the crime was committed, and a description of the arrest.
